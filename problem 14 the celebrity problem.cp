Problem:-
You are in a party of N people, where only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesnâ€™t know anyone in the party. Your task is to find the stranger (celebrity) in party.
You will be given a square matrix M[][] where if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to complete the function getId() which finds the id of the celebrity if present else return -1. The function getId() takes two arguments, the square matrix M and its size N.

Note: Expected time complexity is O(N) with constant extra space.

Input:
The first line of input contains an element T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains a number denoting the size of the matrix M. Then in the next line are space separated values of the matrix M.

Output:
For each test case output will be the id of the celebrity if present (0 based index). Else -1 will be printed.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function getId() which returns the Id of celebrity if present, else -1.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
2 <= N <= 501
0 <= M[][] <= 1

Example:
Input (To be used only for expected output) :
2
3
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
2
0 1 1 0

Output :
1
-1

Explanation :
For the above test case the matrix will look like
0 1 0 
0 0 0
0 1 0
Here,  the celebrity is the person with index 1 ie id 1 
 





// The task is to complete this function
// M[][]: input matrix
// n: size of matrix (n*n)
// The task is to complete this function
// M[][]: input matrix
// n: size of matrix (n*n)

Solution:-
int getId(int M[MAX][MAX],int n)
{
int a = 0;
int b = n - 1;
while (a < b)
{
if (M[a][b])
a++;
else
b--;
}

for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
{
if ( (j != a) &&
(M[a][j]|| !M[j][a]) )
return -1;
}

return a;
}
